# My-SQL-Queries
1. Retrieve the first and last names and department number and name of all employees directly supervised by James Borg. Show results in ascending alpha order (by last name and then first name).

2. Write an SQL query to determine the 3rd highest salary from employee table without using TOP or limit method.

3. Retrieve the name and number of departments which have employees who do not work on at least one project. Show results in ascending alpha order. (NOTE: a department should appear on this list if it has an employee who does not work on any project at all.)

4. For each department, list the department name and the total number of hours assigned to projects controlled by the department (irrespective of the employee to whom they are assigned) and the total number of hours assigned to employees of the department (irrespective of the project involved). Show results in ascending alpha order.

5. Retrieve the names of departments which have at least one project which employs every one of the employees of the department that controls the project. Also show the name of the project. Show results in ascending alpha order.

6. Retrieve the first and last names of employees who work on projects which are not controlled by their departments. Also show the names of the projects, the employee's department number, and the number of the project's controlling department. (All of this should be shown in the same result table.) Show results in ascending alpha order (by last name and then first name and then project name).

7. Retrieve the first and last names of employees who work on more than the average number of projects. (Note: employees who do not work on any project are to be included in the average.) Display their names, the number of projects they work on, and the average number of projects. (The same average should be repeated in each row.) Show results in ascending alpha order (by last name and then first name). [The average number of projects is the average number of projects worked on per employee.]

8. Retrieve the name and number of the project which uses the most employees. Also show the total number of employees for that project. If there is more than one project that has attained that maximum, list them all. Show results in ascending alpha order.

9. Do any departments have a location in which they have no projects? Retrieve the names of departments which have at least one location which is not the same as any of the locations of the department's projects. Show results in ascending alpha order. [This means that one department location is different from every location of every project of that department.]

10. List the names of dependents that have the same first name as an employee of whom they are not the dependent. Also show the ssn of the employee with the same first name and the ssn of the employee on whom the dependent is dependent (dependent.essn). (All of this should be shown in the same table.) Show results in ascending alpha order.

11. Retrieve the first and last names of employees whose supervisor works on any project outside the employee's department. Show results in ascending alpha order (by last name and then first name). [Note that you are to retrieve the employee's name, not the supervisor's.]
